# Project Title:

Automated Readme Generator

---

# **What is this project about?**

This project has been created using Python to enable you to quickly write a basic Readme.md file that is automatically formatted for your GitHub projects.

# **How do I install this project?:**

Firstly, you’ll need to download the source code from this repository, then set it up on your own GitHub repository and create your own local copy of the files so you can work on them and create your own readme files. To use the automated readme generator, you will then need to set up a virtual environment as follows:
1 Set up a virtual environment using the following command in the terminal window (for Mac) ensuring the environment is being set up in the correct location that you require:
python3 -m venv myenv (This creates a folder myenv containing core environment files.
If you are prompted to select the new environment for the workspace folder, click ‘Yes”
2. Activate the new environment by typing the following command in the terminal window (for Mac):
source myenv/bin/activate
3. This should prepend a (myenv) to the command prompt which tells you that the virtual environment has been activated and is running.
4. Next, load all the dependencies via the requirements.txt file which has been created and saved into the project’s root folder. Use the following command in the terminal window (for Mac):
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Note that to stop the virtual environment, you can type ‘deactivate’ into the terminal window and this will deactivate the virtual environment and is confirmed by the removal of the prepended (myenv) on the command line prompt.

# **How do I use this project?**

You can use this project within Visual Studio Code via the terminal. Once you have installed your Python virtual environment using the instructions above, you can simply start the program in VS code by typing the following command: (Mac users) python3 main.py. This will launch the program and prompt you to answer a set of questions which are then saved to a Readme.md file and also saved as a Readme.html file should that be helpful.
